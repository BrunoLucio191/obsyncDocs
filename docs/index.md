# ObSync

**Self-hosted, real-time collaborative Markdown editing for Obsidian.**

![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-1.0.0-blue.svg) ![TypeScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/TypeScript-5.9-3178C6?logo=typescript\&logoColor=white) ![Node.js](https://img.shields.io/badge/Node.js-ESM-339933?logo=node.js\&logoColor=white) ![Obsidian](https://img.shields.io/badge/Obsidian-Plugin-7C3AED?logo=obsidian\&logoColor=white) ![Yjs](https://img.shields.io/badge/CRDT-Yjs-F5A623)

ObSync pairs an Obsidian plugin with a Node.js backend that you host yourself, allowing a collaborative vault. The note open in the editor is edited through [Yjs](https://yjs.dev) over a WebSocket connection; everything else in the vault (files, folders, renames, binaries) is kept in sync over HTTP.

There are two roles:

- **`admin`** accounts publish their changes to the shared vault, so everyone connected sees them.
- **`user`** accounts receive everything admins publish, but their own edits stay on their device and are never sent back.

The backend is the source of truth and enforces this on its own, so the guarantee does not depend on the plugin behaving correctly.

## How it works

```text
Obsidian (plugin)                                   Backend (Node.js)

admin edits active note ─── WSS /<note> (Yjs) ────▶ room: check role, apply, broadcast, save
user edits active note ──── (stays local)
any client ◀──────────────── WSS /<note> (Yjs) ──── room broadcasts admin edits
admin creates/renames file ─ HTTPS /api/sync/* ───▶ write to vault, broadcast event
any client ◀──────────────── WSS /system ────────── vault events
plugin start ◀────────────── HTTPS /initSync ────── whole vault as ZIP (skipped if unchanged)
```

There are two independent sync mechanisms:

| Mechanism         | What it moves                                                                | Transport                                 |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Collaboration** | The text of the note open in the editor, character by character              | One WebSocket per open note, Yjs protocol |
| **File sync**     | Vault structure and whole-file content of everything else, binaries included | HTTPS up, `/system` WebSocket events down |

**Collaboration.** Everyone with the same note open shares one room on the backend, with one `Y.Doc`. Updates from non-admin connections are dropped and logged as `[Audit] Global Yjs update blocked`. On a `user` client the editor's document is never attached to the network: the plugin keeps a separate network document that only receives. Each note is stored twice, as `.yjs-state` (the binary Yjs state, needed so reconnecting clients do not duplicate text) and as the readable `.md`.

**File sync.** When the plugin starts it downloads the vault as a ZIP, unless its saved **vault gene** (a fingerprint of the vault in `backend/data/gene.json`) still matches the server's, in which case the server answers `204`. After that, an admin's local creates, modifies, deletes and renames are sent over HTTP, and the backend broadcasts them on `/system`. Files a `user` edited locally are not overwritten: the plugin does a three-way merge with the last server version, writing conflict markers when both sides changed the same lines. Binaries cannot be merged, so the server version is saved next to the local one as `name (server version).ext`.

**Ordering.** Operations from one client run in the order they were sent (one queue per client id), and two operations on the same resource never overlap (a shared `KeyedLock`). Messages inside a collaboration room are processed in arrival order, only after the room has loaded its state from disk.

## Getting started

These steps take a fresh clone to a signed-in plugin talking to your own backend on the same machine. Commands run from the repository root unless a step says otherwise.

### Requirements

- **Node.js 22.18 or newer.** The backend runs `.ts` files directly and uses the built-in `node:sqlite` module, so there is no backend build step.
- Obsidian 1.13.1 or newer.

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

The repository is an npm workspace, so this installs both `backend` and `plugin/obSync`.

### 2. Configure the backend

Generate a signing secret:

```bash
openssl rand -base64 48
```

Create `backend/.env`:

```dotenv
OBSYNC_TOKEN_SECRET=<paste the value generated above>
PORT=3000
OBSYNC_HOST=127.0.0.1
OBSYNC_REQUIRE_TLS=false
OBSYNC_TRUST_PROXY=false
```

This configuration is for local development only. Changing the secret signs everyone out.

### 3. Create the user database

```bash
npm run db:setup
```

`db:setup` refuses to touch an existing database, and the backend refuses to start without one. It prints one line per seeded account with a random temporary password:

```text
[Database] Seed: initial accounts created.
[Database]   foobar@gmail.com — temporary password (admin): Ax7f...
[Database]   barfoo@gmail.com — temporary password (user): Qm2k...
```

**Copy the admin password now.** It is shown only once. The seed accounts are defined in `backend/users/UserDB.ts`. To start over, stop the backend, delete `backend/data/users.sqlite*` and run the command again.

### 4. Start the backend

```bash
npm run dev --workspace=backend
```

Leave it running. It prints `Server running on http://127.0.0.1:3000` when it is ready, and restarts when a backend file changes.

### 5. Build and install the plugin

The build type-checks before bundling, and the bundled Web Worker file it needs is generated by the bundler, so a fresh clone needs one bundle first:

```bash
cd plugin/obSync
node esbuild.config.mjs production
npm run build
```

Copy `main.js`, `manifest.json` and `styles.css` into `<your vault>/.obsidian/plugins/obsync/` and enable **ObSync** under **Settings → Community plugins**.

### 6. Connect and sign in

Open **Settings → ObSync**, enter `http://127.0.0.1:3000` as the **Backend server URL**, save, and sign in with the admin account. Use `127.0.0.1` rather than `localhost`, which may resolve to IPv6 where nothing is listening.

### 7. Change the temporary password

Go to **Settings → ObSync → Account** and set a real password. If you forget it, you have to re-create the user database.

### 8. Try it with two accounts

Sign in as the `user` seed account in a second vault (or a second device) and open the same note in both. Text typed by the admin appears in both; text typed by the user stays only on the user's side. New accounts are created under **Settings → ObSync → User management**.

### Installing from the Obsidian Community Plugins directory

Only the person running the backend needs steps 1 to 4. Everyone else installs ObSync from **Settings → Community plugins → Browse** and starts at step 6 with the backend URL and an account provided by that person.

## Reaching the backend from other devices

### Loopback and allowed addresses

A loopback address is one a machine uses to talk to itself. Traffic sent to it never leaves the machine, so nobody on the network can read it, and plain HTTP is safe there. ObSync recognizes exactly three loopback hosts: `127.0.0.1`, `::1` and `localhost`. Any other address, including other `127.x.x.x` addresses, counts as non-loopback.

**Backend (`OBSYNC_HOST`).** Any address is accepted, but a non-loopback one such as `192.168.1.50` or `0.0.0.0` only starts with `OBSYNC_REQUIRE_TLS=true` and `OBSYNC_TRUST_PROXY=true`. The backend never handles TLS itself: it trusts `X-Forwarded-Proto: https` from a reverse proxy and rejects anything else with `426`.

It accepts that header from any sender. If the backend listens on a network address, any machine that can reach port 3000 can send the header over plain HTTP and pass the check. Keep `OBSYNC_HOST=127.0.0.1` with the proxy on the same machine, or firewall port 3000 so only the proxy can reach it.

**Plugin (backend URL).** `http://` is accepted only for the three loopback hosts. Anything else must be `https://`; the WebSocket URL becomes `wss://`.

| Backend URL in the plugin    | Accepted                            |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `http://127.0.0.1:3000`      | Yes, loopback                       |
| `https://192.168.1.50:8443`  | Yes, HTTPS through the proxy        |
| `https://obsync.example.com` | Yes, HTTPS through the proxy        |
| `http://192.168.1.50:3000`   | No, plain HTTP on a network address |

### Example: Caddy on your LAN

Run [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com) on the backend machine:

```text
# Caddyfile, with the LAN IP of the machine running Caddy
https://192.168.1.50:8443 {
	tls internal
	reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:3000
}
```

The site address must include the IP: with a bare `:8443` Caddy issues no certificate and the handshake fails. Give the machine a fixed IP, since the certificate is valid for that IP only.

1. In `backend/.env`, keep `OBSYNC_HOST=127.0.0.1` and set `OBSYNC_REQUIRE_TLS=true` and `OBSYNC_TRUST_PROXY=true`. From then on every client, including the one on the backend machine, uses `https://<lan-ip>:8443`.
1. Run `caddy run --config Caddyfile` and open port 8443 in the firewall.
1. Run `caddy trust`, then install Caddy's root certificate (`pki/authorities/local/root.crt` inside Caddy's data folder) on every other device. On iOS, also enable it under Settings → General → About → Certificate Trust Settings. Android ignores user-installed certificates in most apps, so Obsidian there will likely reject it.

For a public server, use a real domain and let Caddy get a public certificate instead of `tls internal`.

## Security

| Credential                | Lifetime                         | Used for                                 |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Access token (signed JWT) | 15 minutes                       | `Authorization: Bearer` on HTTP requests |
| Refresh token             | 30 days, rotated on every use    | Getting a new access token               |
| WebSocket ticket          | 30 seconds, one use, one channel | Opening exactly one WebSocket            |

- Every credential belongs to a session kept **in memory**, so logout and revocation are immediate, and **restarting the backend signs everyone out**.
- Every request reloads the user from SQLite, so a role change applies at once. Changing a user's role, status or name closes their sockets, and the reconnect picks up the new role.
- The browser WebSocket API cannot send an `Authorization` header, so the plugin trades its access token for a ticket and sends it in `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol`.
- Passwords are hashed with scrypt. Login is blocked for 15 minutes after 5 failures for one account or 25 from one IP.
- Tokens are stored in Obsidian's `SecretStorage`, never in `data.json`.
- `/system` is receive-only: any message from a client closes the socket.

## Storage

| Where                        | Contents                                                                      |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `backend/data/users.sqlite`  | Accounts and roles                                                            |
| `backend/data/vault/`        | The canonical shared vault, as ordinary files                                 |
| `backend/data/yjs-state/`    | Binary Yjs state of each note ever opened in collaboration                    |
| `backend/data/gene.json`     | The vault gene                                                                |
| `backend/data/zips/`         | Temporary ZIPs for the initial download, deleted 15 s after sending           |
| Obsidian `SecretStorage`     | Access and refresh tokens, saved vault gene                                   |
| Plugin `data.json`           | Backend URL, current user, token expiry                                       |
| IndexedDB                    | Yjs history per note, separate for admin and each `user`, for offline editing |
| `<plugin folder>/sync-base/` | `user` accounts only: last server version of each file, the base for merges   |

Everything under `backend/data/` is runtime data. There are no migrations.

| Admin changes do not reach other clients                           | The acting account must be `admin`; check `[Sync]` errors on the backend and that the other clients have a `/system` connection |
| Conflict markers in a `user`'s file                                | Both the user and an admin changed the same lines; the markers keep both versions                                               |
